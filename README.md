The main finding of this study was that the most important risk factors in predicting obesity are eating habits and physical activity levels. The analysis of obesity/overweight data using ML algorithms in the current research did not produce brand-new risk factors. However, it did help us to understand some information: first, how the identified risk factors are related to weight change, and second, how the results will guide research aimed at preventing “obesity and overweight” and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Consequently, increasing participation in physical activity and regulating eating habits should be the focus of strategies for the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity.

. Conclusions
Within the scope of this study, the LR model emerged as the frontrunner, highlighting
a level of performance better than that of alternative methodologies. The strategic integra-
tion of feature-selection methods further amplified the model’s efficiency, reinforcing its
applicability in real-world scenarios. These findings serve as a poignant reminder of the
interconnectedness between physical activity and nutritional habits in combatting obesity.
